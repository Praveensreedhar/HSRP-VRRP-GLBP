# HSRP-VRRP-GLBP

## HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) Configuration)

HSRP is a redundancy protocol used for providing redundancy in Local network. HSRP is cisco propriority protocol. 
HSRP allows as to configure one active and one or more standby router. All the routers in a single hsrp group shares a sigle virtual IP and MAC address.
The active router is responsible for forwarding traffic from lan, if it fails the standby router become active and it will continue frowarding traffic.

### Terms used in HSRP
#### 1. Virtual IP
This virtual IP is taken from the same subnet from the interface which is participated in hsrp configuration. This IP is the gateway for all the LAN devices.
#### 2. Virtual MAC Address
xt This MAC address in automatically generated by the HSRP protocol. The first 24bit will be default csco MAC adderess (0000.0c) and the next 16 bit is the HSRP ID ( 07AC) and the last 8 bit will be the HSRP group id.
#### 3. Hello messages 
which is used as herat beat signal to check status of teh peer devices. Default hello timer will be 3 sec.
#### 4. Hold timer
Hold timer will be 10 sec
#### 5. Priority
By default priority value is 100. We can change this value and the higher priority value will became the active router.
#### 6. Preempt
It is a state in which the standby router automatically becomes the active router when the link back again.
### HSRP has two Versions
version 1 : The messages are multicast at 224.0.0.2 and uses the UDP port 1985. This version allows group number range from 0 to 255.
version 2 : The messages are multicast at 224.0.0.102 and uses the UDP port 1985. This version allows group number range from 0 to 4095.

#### Active Router configuration

GWR1#(config) int fa0/0

GWR1#(config-if)ip add 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0

GWR1#(config-if) standby 1 ip 192.168.1.3

GWR1#(config-if) standby 1 name HSRP_TEST

GWR1#(config-if) standby 1 priority 110

GWR1#(config-if) standby 1 preempt

#### Standby Router configuration

GWR1#(config) int fa0/0

GWR2#(config-if)ip add 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0

GWR2#(config-if) standby 1 ip 192.168.1.3

GWR2#(config-if) standby 1 name HSRP_TEST

GWR2#(config-if) standby 1 priority 110

GWR2#(config-if) standby 1 preempt
